# A600KB: Mechanical keyboard Amiga A600

Forks/deviant of
(https://github.com/aeberbach/A600KB)

To make one you need:
- 78 MX PCB-mount switches, use 5 pin for easier alignment.    
- 32-way FFC connector (Mouser part number 538-52044-3245)
- 32-way ribbon cable (Mouser part number 538-15168-0400)
- keyswitch stabiliser for Tab and Enter keys (screw in type)
- one 3mm LED for CapsLock

Keycaps:
like switches is obviously subjective there are a number of approachs.    You can use cheap ones, but the 600 has a several nonstand sizes so I tried to lay out some options. 
You can have custom keycaps printed like from a vendor like http://maxkeyboard.com/ but have every key custom made will quickly become expensive and time consuming.

I've made custom adapters that at 3d printable that you will be able to use the orignal keycaps for.   Since this is s first release please consider beta quality.
